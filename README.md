canvasCards
===========

Messing with a basic card game to learn how to use canvas.

So far drag and drop are implemented, which includes basic detection of which card is currently clicked, and changing the render order to bring the currently selected card to the top.

Later features will include the ability to flip the cards, and evertually a full solitaire game, complete with tableau and foundation piles.
